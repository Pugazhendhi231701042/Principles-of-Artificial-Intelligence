Implementation of K-mean algorithm
Aim
To implement the K-Means clustering algorithm on a small
dataset and group data into clusters.
Code
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
X = [[1, 2], [1, 4], [5, 8], [6, 9], [1, 0], [6, 6]]
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0)
kmeans.fit(X)
print("Cluster labels:", kmeans.labels_)
Output
Cluster labels: [1 1 0 0 1 0]
Result
The algorithm grouped the data into 2 clusters. Points with
similar positions are assigned the same cluster label.
