Implementation of Forward Chaining
Aim
To implement a concise Forward Chaining algorithm that infers conclusions based on known
facts and rules.
Code
def forward_chaining(kb, goal):
 facts = set(kb['facts'])
 added = True
 while added:
 added = False
 for rule in kb['rules']:
 if rule['then'] not in facts and all(cond in facts for cond in rule['if']):
 facts.add(rule['then'])
 added = True
 return goal in facts
kb = {
 'facts': ['Sunny', 'Weekend'],
 'rules': [
 {'if': ['Sunny', 'Weekend'], 'then': 'GoForPicnic'},
 {'if': ['GoForPicnic'], 'then': 'PackLunch'}
 ]
}
goal = 'PackLunch'
print(f"Should we pack lunch? =>", forward_chaining(kb, goal))
Output
Should we pack lunch? => True
Result
The system correctly inferred that we should pack lunch, based on the initial facts 'Sunny'
and 'Weekend'.
